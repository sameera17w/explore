### Problem 1 - Ad Placements

Claire wants to publish advertisements about a hair dryer. She has 3 options.
* Medium 1:	Ad placement in an entertainment magazine feature pages (maximum 1)
* Medium 2:	A box ad in a sunday magazine
* Medium 3:	Classified ads

These advertisements are placed through an ad-agency, and they requires an advertising budget, as well as a professional services budget.

She has limited budget, and Medium 1 is limited due to space.
* Resource 1: Advertising budget (US$ 400,000)
* Resource 2: Professional services budget (US$ 100,000)

The results of the campaigns are measured as exposures; the number of people the ads are viewed by. These figures are usually given by brand monitoring agencies.

Cost Category      | Cost per Ad in Medium 1 | Cost per Ad in Medium 2 | Cost per Ad in Medium 3
------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -----------------------
Advertising budget | $ 30,000 | $ 15,000 | $ 10,000
Professional services budget | $ 9,000 | $ 3,000 | $ 4,000
Expected exposure | 130,000 | 60,000 | 50,000

Challenges is to find the best combination of advertisements within the budget to maximize the exposure, thus making sure Claire's campaign is successful.
